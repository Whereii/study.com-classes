The overall application of this class was appreciated but I found the lack of guidence disturbing. The final project (which i recieved 100% on) was extremly poorly designed.
Very little direction was provided and I found that it also had much unessary content refering to the final 500 inserts that were required to complete the class.
I ended up writing a small piece of js code which I then used to copy and paste the required inserts and conver them to SQL statments.
